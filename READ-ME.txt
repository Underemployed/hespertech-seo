CASE STUDY:
[1.] Case Study: Custom 1-Ton Construction Hoist – 68 Feet (4+G Height)
Client: R Sanjaykumar, Managing Director, SK Builders & Developers
Project Background
SK Builders & Developers approached Hesper Tech Pvt Ltd with a unique challenge: design
a material hoist tailored for their high-rise building projects — not just another standard unit,
but a completely re-engineered solution that addressed both versatility and site-specific
constraints.
Client Requirements & Design Challenges:
• Wider Bucket Design: To fit at least 2 large cement bucket trolleys without spillage or
imbalance.
• Personnel Safety: The hoist had to be stable and secure for safe transport of workers
across all levels.
• Anchor-Free Mechanism: No permanent anchors were to be used at different levels,
enabling the free movement of materials like 6-meter-long rods and other oversized raw
construction supplies.
• Unique Layout: The design was to stand out from conventional hoists, functionally and
visually.
• Cost-Effective Build: It had to be engineered to balance affordability and reliability.
• Tight Deadline: Everything — from ideation and design to testing and final delivery —
had to be wrapped up within 5 months.
Hesper Tech’s Solution:
Our team took a collaborative and hands-on approach, turning these unique demands into a
full-fledged solution:
• Reimagined Structure: Developed a brand-new hoist framework that could function
without anchoring at different levels, while still ensuring stability at 68 feet height.
• Reinforced, Oversized Bucket: Designed to carry at least 2 wide cement trolleys and
even 6m steel rods without disrupting balance or motion.
• Safety-Centric Features: Introduced stable cable-based pulley, guide rails, and fail-safe
brake motors for safe personnel movement.

• Optimized Load Handling: Engineered the lifting mechanism for smooth elevation and
descent across variable loads.
• Rapid Execution: Despite the design complexity, we met the five-month delivery
timeline, including structural testing and on-site integration.
Impact & Outcome:
• Client’s Vision Realized: The final system addressed every specific need — including
spatial constraints, functionality, and worker safety.
• Improved Site Productivity: Transport of both materials and labour became faster and
more flexible.
• Anchor-Free Versatility: Enabled easier manoeuvring and transportation of raw
materials, helping streamline construction flow.
• Delivered On Time: Completed within the promised timeframe, helping SK Builders
avoid project delays.
Conclusion:
This project exemplifies Hesper Tech’s strength in converting non-standard requirements into
smart, real-world solutions. Working closely with R Sanjaykumar and the SK Builders team,
we delivered a hoist that not only matched their expectations — but redefined what a
construction hoist could do in terms of safety, versatility, and design.
[2.] Vibrationless Patient Trolley with Detachable Bed
Collaborating Partners:

structure and damping system to meet the project’s goals.
• Advanced Vibration Damping System – Designed a shock absorption mechanism that
significantly reduces vibrations from uneven floors and sudden movements.
• Detachable Bed Engineering – Developed a lightweight, secure, and easy-to-operate
bed detachment system, ensuring seamless patient transfer with minimal effort.
• Ergonomic & User-Friendly Design – The trolley was designed for hospital and
emergency use, featuring adjustable height, smooth mobility, and easy handling.
• Material Selection & Durability Testing – Ensured the trolley’s structural integrity by
using lightweight but high-strength materials to support varying patient loads.
Outcome & Impact:
• Enhanced Patient Comfort: Significantly reduces vibrations and sudden jolts, making
patient transport safer.
• Efficient Medical Transfers: The detachable bed feature simplifies movement between
medical stations, reducing stress on both patients and healthcare providers.
• Durable & Practical: Built with high-quality materials to ensure long-term reliability in
hospital and emergency environments.
• Innovative Healthcare Solution: This project serves as a benchmark for future
advancements in patient mobility and medical transport technologies.
Conclusion:

example of engineering-driven healthcare innovation. By combining mechanical precision,

medical expertise, and practical design, the project successfully delivers a functional and
patient-friendly solution for hospitals and emergency services.
[3.] High visibility point indicator for non-interlocked/Manual track switching
points
Collaborating Authority: Southern Railway, Thiruvananthapuram Division
Project Partner: Hesper Tech Pvt. Ltd.
Project Title: High Visibility Mechanical Point Indicator for Manual Track Switching
Points.
Overview
This case study highlights the power of hands-on collaboration in solving a pressing
operational challenge on the ground. When the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) of
Thiruvananthapuram Division raised a safety concern regarding manual track switching
in non-interlocked yards, Hesper Tech Pvt. Ltd. was brought in to explore a practical
solution. What followed was a focused and fruitful partnership that resulted in the design,
testing, and deployment of a fully mechanical point indication system—improving
visibility, reducing risk, and strengthening trust between public and private sectors.
The Challenge
In non-interlocked yards like Irumpanam, manual point switching is routine. However,
the absence of a visual feedback mechanism left loco pilots and ground staff relying on
verbal confirmation or physical inspection to determine the direction of the switched
track. This led to frequent delays, misrouted movements, and heightened safety risks—
particularly during low visibility conditions. The DRM recognized this as a significant
operational gap and approached Hesper Tech to develop a system that could be
implemented quickly and maintained with ease.
Our Solution
Hesper Tech proposed a fully mechanical, low-maintenance system that would work
seamlessly alongside existing railway infrastructure. The key requirements were:
• Independence from electrical power
• High visibility during both day and night
• Compact, modular design for easy installation and servicing
• Mechanical linkage with the track switch for synchronized movement

A prototype of the Mechanical Point Indicator was built and tested at Trivandrum Central
Yard. The device used a directional arrow mechanically linked to the point switch lever,
ensuring that the indicator accurately reflected the live track position at all times.
From Prototype to Field Deployment
Following successful trials and refinements at Trivandrum Central, two additional units
were deployed for field validation at Marshall Yard and Nagercoil Junction Station.
Feedback from ground teams affirmed the product’s reliability and ease of use. With these
results, Southern Railway approved the installation of nine more indicators at Irumpanam
Yard. Hesper Tech carried out the design, in-house fabrication, and installation of all
twelve units delivered so far.
Implementation Highlights
• Units Delivered: 12 Mechanical Point Indicators (3 trial units + 9 deployed at
Irumpanam Yard)
• Key Supporters: DRM, Sr. DOM, Sr. DEN, ADEN - NCJ, Former Sr. DSO, staff of
Operating & Engineering Departments
• Fabrication: Fully in-house by Hesper Tech Pvt. Ltd.
Impact
• Provided loco pilots with immediate, reliable visual confirmation of point direction
• Improved yard safety and reduced manual coordination requirements
• Enabled quick deployment without electrical infrastructure changes
• Reinforced the potential of field-driven innovation through collaboration
Conclusion
This project stands as a clear example of how collaborative thinking and rapid, on-site
development can address real-world challenges in railway operations. Initiated by a need
identified directly by Southern Railway’s leadership and executed by Hesper Tech with
precision, the Mechanical Point Indicator solution has delivered measurable
improvements in safety and operational clarity. With growing interest and continued
support, further deployments are anticipated across other non-interlocked yards.
